        This is an automated notification from IdentityIQ.&lt;br>&lt;br>
        $identityFullname has transferred.  An Access Verification has been automatically generated for the user's sponsor.&lt;br> 
        This is to allow the sponsor to determine whether $identityFullname's current access should be retained or revoked.&lt;br>
        &lt;br>
        Sincerely,&lt;br>
        Identity Governance Team
