*************

Load the included files via setup.xml and use the "edit css" link on your dashboard. 

To save the template as a new file, add a "save as" configuration name. 

NOTE: if you are just fooling around, take a template and save it as a new config file name. 
Then you are free to mess with the css settings all you want.
