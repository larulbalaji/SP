******************
As Jerry Bennett request access for Amy Cox
Use the "User Based Search" Capability
First go to "Search by Identity" and select Frank Rivera. notice how all looks good (green)
Reset the search
Go to "Search by Population" and explain this is far better as we can now look at access other people have in context.
Enable the checkbox next to "Job Title" (Accounts Payable Analyst) and run the search again.
Explain how we now look at a much broader audience and as a result have much more insight as to what would be appropriate access to request.

Do request both "Accounts Payable Accountant" and "Accounts Receivable Accountant" to show the conflict
Go through with the request
Explain how IIQ warns you about potential conflicts
Explain how you can request with the violation to allow the business to manage exceptions without IT involvement.
Explain how this is a good thing if... one is sick, other broke his leg, not enough people left in the department to maintain SOD
