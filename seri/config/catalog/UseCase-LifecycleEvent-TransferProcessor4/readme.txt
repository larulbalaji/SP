Transfer Processor with Role retention for auto assigned roles.20141211Contact: hrv@sailpoint.com************************* Library dependencies *************************Yes, depends on /seri/xml/Rule/RuleLibrary-Demo-Workflow.xmlAlso depends on the oldJobTitle and transferManager index and Identity attribute defined in ExtendedAttributes. This is handled by SERI build process.************** Execution *************************** Background ***************The transfer processor from the "old" demo with extras.On Manager change it will ask the old manager if access should be retained (and for how long) or revoked.On retain it will rescheduleOn Revoke, it will issue an Access Certification.I added the functionality that on a retain, both the old manager and the new manager can still see the user in their "list" to request or revoke access.Additionally, the oldJobTitle attribute is filled, allowing Role Assignment Rules to reference that next to jobTitle. This allows the Role to remain assigned when the jobTitle changes until after the revoke, when we clear the attribute.*************************** Potential Enhancements ***************************Create an "Update Identity" provisioning policy to allow a selection list based on currently available Job Titles when using IIQ to make the changes to the identity. Could inject an Identity Refresh step after revoke is chosen, before the cert is generated. This would immediately remove all roles that were still assigned based on oldJobTitle.**************** Limitations ****************The "ER Nurse" business role has a "AND" configuration and would require a manual change to add oldJobTitle into the mix, as the roleImporter does not support a combined profile. ***************** To Configure *****************Run Setup.xmlRun the "Extend Demo Role Assignments" task to add the oldJobTitle assignment rulesRun an Identity Refresh with the option "Refresh Identity Attributes"This will populate the "transferManager" attribute for all managers with their own displayable name. (to prevent any manager with a blank attribute to "share" that with all users with a blank attribute)******************* To Demonstrate *******************Note: This demonstrates best from OrangeHRMChange a manager & job title on an Identity.See the workitem for the old manager (Retain / Revoke decision)On Retain, the workflow will be started again on the selected date.On Retain, the user will now show up on both the old manager and new manager's list of people they can request access for. Show how the old manager still has the user in his list, even though the manager is now different.Show how Roles retain access because we populate the oldJobTitle attribute.******************** Version History ********************15-7-2014Added importer for oldJobTitle assignment rules8-5-2014Added access retention for roles with Assignment rules to existing transfer manager scenario.23-6-2014Added a few hidden tasks to make this run on the partner demo system with the "CTRL-ALT-4" shortcut.11-12-2014Added a merge sysconfig to set the transferManager attribute in LCM configuration.********************************* Testing Status/ Known Issues *********************************https://github.com/sailpoint/seri/labels/UseCase-LifecycleEvent-TransferProcessor4
