    <Variable initializer="string:true" name="transient">
      <Description>Set to false to cause workflow-related objects, such as approval
      work items, to be saved in the database even if they are only
      viewed by the person registering.</Description>
    </Variable>
    <Variable input="true" name="batchRequestItemId">
      <Description>Used by the batch interface to record back individual request item status. The specific item id for the individual request in the batch file.</Description>
    </Variable>
    <Variable initializer="string:TerminateUser" name="flow">
      <Description>The name of the LCM flow that launched this workflow.</Description>
    </Variable>
    <Variable editable="true" name="optimisticProvisioning">
      <Description>Set to true to enable optimistic provisioning.  This will cause
      changes to the entitlements compiled from role assignments to be 
      applied immediately to the identity cube rather than waiting
      for the next refresh/reaggregation after the provisioning system
      completes the request.</Description>
    </Variable>
    <Variable editable="true" initializer="string:true" name="foregroundProvisioning">
      <Description>Normally provisioning is done in a step that uses the "backgroud"
      option to force the workfow to be suspend and be resumed in a
      background task thread.  This prevents the browser session from
      hanging since provision can sometimes take a long time.  For demos
      and testing it can be better to do this in the foreground so that
      provisioning will have been performed when control is returned to the
      user.  This prevents having to run the Perform Maintanance task to 
      see the resutls of the request.</Description>
    </Variable>
    <Variable editable="true" initializer="string:false" name="doRefresh">
      <Description>Set to true to cause an identity refresh after the changes in the plan
      have been provisioned.  This is normally off, you might want this on
      if you want modification of identity or link attributes to result in
      an immediate re-evaluation of assigned and detected roles.</Description>

    <Variable initializer="string:serial" input="true" name="approvalMode">
      <Description>A string that specifies how we should handle the approvals.  

     By default this is serial since most of these request with
     the exception of manager transfers will have only one approver.

     parallel
       Approvals are processed concurrently and there must be consensus,
       we wait for all approvers to approve.  The first approver that
       rejects terminates the entire approval.
 
     parallelPoll 
       Approvals are processed concurrently but consensus is not required.
       All approvals will be process, we don't stop if there any
       rejections.  

     serial
       Approvals are processed one at a time and there must be consensus.
       The first approver that rejects terminates the entire approval.

     serialPoll
       Approvals are processed in order but consensus is not required.
       All approvals will be processed, we don't stop if there are any
       rejections.  In effect we are "taking a poll" of the approvers.

     any
      Approvals are processed concurrently, the first approver to 
      respond makes the decision for the group.</Description>
