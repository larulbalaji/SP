This is just a simple workaround for setting view attributes
Once imported, there will be a QuickLink under Manage->Identity (TODO: Move, and restrict access? Let's see what 6.1 gives us here. Also make it transient)

Click the link to start the workflow. It will take you to an "approval" process where all identity mappings are listed.
The ones marked "Rejected" are not displayed
The ones marked "Approved" are displayed in the identity cube front page.
Complete the task, and the identityViewAttributes property will be updated.
