Connector Registry v1.0.0
30 September 2016

Author: marc.gamache@sailpoint.com

**************
* Background *
**************

This workflow allows a user with the 'ConnectorRegistry' capability or a system administrator to change the 'hidden' connectors so that they appear in the Application Type dropdown when configuring a new application.

*************
* Limitations *
*************
The workflow does not currently support reverting a connector back to 'hidden' in the registry.

*************
* Execution *
*************
A user with either 'ConnectorRegistry' capability or a system administrator will see a Quicklink called 'ConnectorRegistry' under Tools. 
Click on that Quicklink and you will be able to enable the 'hidden' connectors one by one.
